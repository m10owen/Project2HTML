# Why is it important for each radio button to have a unique ID?
This is important so we can edit the buttons on their own and know which button is which. 

# How can we ensure that only one character can be selected at a time?
We do this by making the buttons radio buttons. This makes it so only one button can be selected. 

# What could happen if the labels aren't correctly associated with the radio buttons? 
If the labels arn't correctly associated then the user would not be able to know which button is actually the button they want to press. 

# Why do you think checkboxes were used instead of a dropdown menu for selecting supplies? What advantages or disadvantages does this approach offer?

Check boxes were used since they let the user see all their options without having to drop down. The disadvamtage is you have to create a l9imit for number of selected checkboxes.
